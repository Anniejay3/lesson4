<p>
    My name is Annalisa Jaynes and I am currently attending Wake Tech Community College as a Advertising Graphic Design Major. I have some past college in Multi Media Design. I also have many years of experience in Photography, color photo development as well as training in black and white photo dark room development.
</p>
    <p>
    I am very passionate about art, design and creativity. I love to design and create in various ways, such as costume design, fashion, sculpting, jewelry, architecture, mixed media pieces, computer design, surrealism pieces, photography and the list goes on. I have experience in photography. I also have experience in color black and white photo development. Being in the dark room is one of my favorite places to be, it feels like an escape to a little dark world of magic. I also love to cook and make my own recipes up when I have the extra time. Creating is my passion and I look forward to learning and expanding my skills this semester and in the future. </p>
